        -IMPORTANT: This is a still developing app so it does not work smoothly as the others we advise you to follow the following steps:

        -In order to play you have to invite a friend by his exact username or you can select from your friends list.
        -There are no invite acception option so you have to invite eachother seperately and play your game.
        -You will be able to see the list after you are both finished so be sure both of you have finished the list.
        -You will know the list that we gave you ended after the like or dislike buttons dissappear and a button on middle appears.
        -Other than theese the app is pretty self explained so have fun :)
        -KNOWN BUGS:
            -Sometimes one players list doesnt appear because of the database, not that there is anything wrong with it but the data doesnt gets to the app.
